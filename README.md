# Useful Jupyter Notebook based tutorials tied to Machine Learning

Jupyter Notebook based tutorials

[Setup Machine Learning Environment](env_setup.ipynb)

[Setup PlaidML keras backend](setup_plaidml.ipynb)

See under `keras` folder for keras based tutorials

See under `cv2_dlib` folder for tutorials using simple computer vision and face detection tools

If github is having issues rendering the Jupyter Notebooks, you have two options:

1) use nbviewer at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
copy and paste the URL at github that contain ipynb.  Example:
https://github.com/sspak9/jup/blob/master/keras/keras_ann.ipynb


2) please clone the repository, open the env_setup.html, and follow the steps to setup your local instance of Jupyter Notebook
You will first need to install git, if you have not already done so:
